# Personal-Portfolio
Personal Portfolio from scratch utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I am just getting started with front-end development. I am working slowly to expand my knowledge and eventually land a development job.
Any help is greatly appreciated!

Here's the link to the figma file i'm referencing: https://www.figma.com/file/Ual9YJXZ3WmvtZr8e1GrSS/%F0%9F%8E%A8-Personal-Portfolio-Template-(Community)?type=design&node-id=203%3A55&mode=design&t=XD0njEovl7RRoXdp-1

Thanks!
